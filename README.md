# OpenGL-rendering-for-3D-MAPF
Hello my freind, welcome to this OpenGL repo.

The python3 file "3D_drawing" is a tiny UI for RL based 3D-MAPF demonstration.

Input: 
two 3D metrices world and goals, they must be "cube" metrices, which means that height == width == length

Output:
A exe window virsualizes the given world and goals metrices, which allows you to change projection through mouse dragging.
